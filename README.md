# dcpythonproject
This is a game project from Python

The purpose of this project is to feature the Python fundamentals that we have learned over the course of two weeks.

We had implemented different aspects such as Classes, Functions, and Importing from one file to the next. Also we call unique modules into our code, such as Random, to produce random integers or choices based on our logic.

The project was originally intended to be a "Virtual Pet." However, I sought to add more user interactions and randomize outcomes based on how a random function affects relevant attributes .
